A small 2D game with a graphical library, in which a player collects all collectibles && exits the game.

Its purpose is to work with window management, event handling, textures, sprites, colors && some other very basic gameplay elements.

The school graphical library 'the MiniLibX' is used. This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images && deal with keyboard and mouse events.
